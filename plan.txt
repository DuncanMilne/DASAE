SERVER
- Maintain a list of currently active auctions
- Maintain the state of each auction
  - Server is responsible for identifying and processing 'finished' auctions:
    * Callback to bidders
    * Remove it from list of active auctions
    * 'Store' the finished auction's data somehow
- Individual handler threads for each connected client (???)
- Retain finished auction info for querying
- Save/restore state from permanent memory
  - Can be used to 'bootstrap' or initialise the server for testing
- Failure detection
  - Some kind of 'heartbeat' mechanism?
  - Could have the heartbeat give some info about server load?
