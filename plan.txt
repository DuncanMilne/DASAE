CLIENT  // X indicates I have added it to the interface
- Create auction items X
  - [name, min item value, close time, id] X
  - for auction close times we could ask the user to enter a date and a time in format DD/MM/YYYY and HH/MM/SS and then convert to seconds (handout says it needs to be specified in seconds)
- Bid against auction items X
- View available auction items X
- Query 'finished' auctions X
- Be notified of the auction result
  - Via a callback  X
  - Provide info about bid/auction status   // Need to still provide info
- 'Heartbeat' check that server is still responsive X

SERVER
- Maintain a list of currently active auctions X
- Maintain the state of each auction
  - Server is responsible for identifying and processing 'finished' auctions:
    * Callback to bidders // DONE
    * Remove it from list of active auctions // DONE
    * 'Store' the finished auction's data somehow
- Individual handler threads for each connected client (???) //?
- Retain finished auction info for querying
- Save/restore state from permanent memory
  - Can be used to 'bootstrap' or initialise the server for testing
- Failure detection X
  - Some kind of 'heartbeat' mechanism? X
  - Could have the heartbeat give some info about server load?

kelvin says not to bother with saving/restoring auction state to/from permanent storage


STILL TO DO
List available items in nicer format
notify in nicer format. Also let them know if they won, the winners id should be printed as well as the winning bid
after auctions finish they should still be queryable for a time
instantiate server with auctions. can set these
if auctionclient takes an argument "test" create 1k clients
ensure remoteexceptions are caught within methods that do callbacks to the client
allow users to ping server to check if its still alive and return server load
each client has a list of the itemids which tracks which item they created, when they try to bid on an item check if its in this list, if it is dont allow bid

report ideas
reconnecting clients could be an extension
extension possibility - could track all clients and ping them all from the server side. this would allow the server to only be connected to
